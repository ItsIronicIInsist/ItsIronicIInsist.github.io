<p>I am running for President (<span style="color: red">SUPREME DICTATOR</span>) and/or Vice President (<span style="color: red">PUPPET MASTER</span>).</p>
<h2 id="the-plan">THE PLAN</h2>
<p>Things that I&#39;m particularly interested in getting going next year are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Weekly meetups every term</li>
<li>More education workshops, particularly smaller scale ones <ul>
<li>Maybe integrated into weekly meetups?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Something Amazing V2 (Where we rip-off Something Awesome)<ul>
<li>Because self-teaching is baller. (⛹️⛹️⛹️)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Mainly I want to foster a good learning environment where everyone feels welcomed!</p>

<p>In first year I was in the CTF/Education subcom where I helped create CTFs like the Skylight CTF and the CSEsocXSecSoc CTF.</p>
<p>This year I was one of the CTF directors, helping run all the CTFs that SecSoc held!</p>
<p>Im also rather active at most SecSoc events, so you've probably seen me lurking around.</p>
