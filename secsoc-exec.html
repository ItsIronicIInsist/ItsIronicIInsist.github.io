<h1 id="welcome">WELCOME</h1>
<p>I am running for President (SUPREME DICTATOR) and Vice President (PUPPET MASTER).</p>
<h2 id="the-plan">THE PLAN</h2>
<p>Things that I&#39;m particularly interested in getting going next year are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Weekly meetups every term</li>
<li>More education workshops, particularly smaller scale ones <ul>
<li>Maybe integrated into weekly meetups?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Something Amazing V2 (Where we rip-off Something Awesome)<ul>
<li>Because self-teaching is baller. (⛹️⛹️⛹️)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Mainly I want to foster a good learning environment where everyone feels welcomed!</p>
<h2 id="past-existence">PAST EXISTENCE</h2>
<p>In first year I was in the CTF/Education subcom where I helped create CTFs like the Skylight CTF and the CSEsocXSecSoc CTF.</p>
<p>This year I was one of the CTF directors, helping run all the CTFs that SecSoc held!</p>
<p>Im also rather active at most SecSoc events (try recalling a tall lanky guy with epic hair).</p>
<h2 id="other-stuff">Other stuff</h2>
<p>I&#39;ve given talks at both SCONES, and some other cons so you know I&#39;m a nerd (thus good fit for exec :)  )</p>
